# Cube Sorter

This is a project that uses an Arduino to sort 3 cubes. The cubes are numbered according to the polarity of the two magnets on top of them.
The Arduino is connected to a two motors which move the blocks under two hall effect sensors which measure the polarity of the magnets.
A tray is shifted so that the cubes will be pushed into the correct position. This project worked perfectly.
